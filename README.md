# Skin-Care-Recommendation

This project uses deep learning and transfer learning (VGG16) to classify skin types as dry, normal, or oily based on input images. Once the skin type is predicted, it recommends skincare products by matching the predicted type with a skincare product dataset. The model is trained on custom skin images, achieving strong accuracy. Live webcam image capture is also supported for real-time predictions. This project combines computer vision with a real-world product recommendation system for skincare solutions. Built using TensorFlow, OpenCV, Streamlit, and Pandas.
Model saved as pv.keras.
